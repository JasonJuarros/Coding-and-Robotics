# Coding-and-Robotics
A collection of code I have written throughout my years in high school

This is a variety of coding I have done. Several different languages and platforms were used in this compilation.
Some of the code requires hardware to be completed or fully understood.

The "Choose your own adventure" file allows the user to change the course of the story. The code asks and responds
correctly to user input throughout the story.

The "GPA Calculater" file allows the user to input their information and the code will calculate their GPA.

The "LightSensorDisplay" file continuously prints a picture of a car. Then it uses phototransistors to measure light
and move the car left and right.

The "RubeGoldberg" file codes an Arduino 101 board to sense a change in tilt, which activates an LCD screen to print
a message.

The "Light Show" file uses an Arduino 101 board and LED lights to blink to the beat of music.

The "Racecar picture" file prints a picture of a racecar that I made using a variety of different lines and shapes on a graph.
